# Experiment-02: Implementation of combinational logic
Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
```
F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
```
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II, USB flasher
2. Software – Quartus prime


## Theory:
Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical functions on one or more inputs to produce one output.
 

## Logic Diagram:


## Procedure:
### Step 1:
Create a project with required entities.

Step 2: Create a module along with respective file name.

Step 3: Run the respective programs for the given boolean equations.

Step 4: Run the module and get the respective RTL outputs.

Step 5: Create university program(VWF) for getting timing diagram.

Step 6: Give the respective inputs for timing diagram and obtain the results.

## Program:
```
Program to implement the given logic function and to verify its operations in quartus using
Verilog programming.
